# L2SP
This is the code to implement Structure learning with Similarity Perserving (L2SP) framework. We demonstrate four experiments in this repository. Use runL2SPs to test sparse regularizer on clustering problems; use runL2SPr to test low-rank on clustering problems; use runL2SPssemi to test sparse regularizer on semisupervised classification problems and use runL2SPrsemi to test low-rank on semisupervised classification problems. We use YALE as a data sample here, please feel free to try your own datasets. TNNLS is the implementation of our deep clustering.
